# 42 C project: libft

This project consisted in re-coding standard C functions and adding them to our very own library: **libft**.

As time went by, other useful functions have been added to it, namely :
* **Get_Next_Line**, a C function useful for reading from a given source (*standard input* or an *opened file*) line by line
* **ft_printf**, a re-coding of the very useful function *printf* (you can also find it [here](https://github.com/uboumedj/ft_printf)).

Using the library remains the same, just run `make` to create the **libft.a** library.
